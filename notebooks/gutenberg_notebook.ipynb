strew meadow . those figure be so silent and furtive that one feel somehow confront by forbidden thing , with which would be good to have nothing to do . when a rise in the road bring the mountain in view above the deep wood , the feeling of strange uneasiness be increase . the summit be too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness , and sometimes the sky silhouette with especial clearness the queer circle of tall stone pillar with which most of be crown . gorges and ravine of problematical depth intersect the way , and the crude wooden bridge always seem of dubious safety . when the road dip again there be stretch of marshland that one instinctively dislike , and indeed almost fear at evening when unseen whippoorwill chatter and the firefly come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous , creepily insistent rhythm of stridently pip bullfrog . the thin , shin line of the \\'s upper reach have an oddly serpentlike suggestion as wind close to the foot of the domed hill among which rise . as the hill draw nearer , one heed wooded side more than stone - crown top . those side loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wish would keep distance , but there be no road by which to escape . across a covered bridge one see a small village huddle between the stream and the vertical slope of , and wonder at the cluster of rot gambrel roof bespeak an early architectural period than that of the neighboring region . be not reassure to see , on a close glance , that most of the house be desert and fall to ruin , and that the break - steepl church now harbor the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet . one dread to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge , yet there be no way to avoid . once across , be hard to prevent the impression of a faint , malign odor about the village street , as of the massed mold and decay of century . be always a relief to get clear of the place , and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hill and across the level country beyond till rejoin the pike . afterward one sometimes learn that one have be through . outsider visit as seldom as possible , and since a certain season of horror all the signboard point toward have be take down . the scenery , judge by any ordinary esthetic canon , be more than commonly beautiful ; yet there be no influx of artist or summer tourist . two century ago , when talk of witch - blood , - , and strange forest presence be not laugh at , be the custom to give reason for avoid the locality . in sensible age ‚Äî since the horror of    be hush up by those who have the town \\'s and the world \\'s welfare at heart ‚Äî people shun without know exactly why . perhaps one reason ‚Äî though can not apply to uninformed stranger ‚Äî be that the native be now repellently decadent , have go far along that path of retrogression so common in many backwater . have come to form a race by , with the well - define mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding . the average of intelligence be wofully low , whilst annals reek of overt viciousness and of half - hide murder , incest , and deed of almost unnamable violence and perversity . the old gentry , represent the two or three armigerous family which come from in   , have keep somewhat above the general level of decay ; though many branch be sink into the sordid populace so deeply that only name remain as a key to the origin disgrace . some of the and bishop still send eld son to and , though those son seldom return to the molder gambrel roof under which and ancestor be bear . no one , even those who have the fact concern the recent horror , can say just what be the matter with ; though old legend speak of unhallowed rite and conclave of the indians , amidst which call forbid shape of shadow out of the great rounded hill , and make wild orgiastic prayer that be answer by loud cracking and rumbling from the ground below . in    the , newly come to the at , preach a memorable sermon on the close presence of and imp , in which say : must be allow\\'d that these blasphemy of an infernall train of d√¶mons be matter of too common to be deny\\'d ; the cursed voices of and , of and , be hear from under by above a score of credible witness now live . do not more than a fortnight ago catch a very plain of evill powers in the behind ; wherein there be a and , , , and , such as no thing of this cou\\'d raise up , and which must need have come from those caves that only black can discover , and only the unlock . . disappear soon after deliver this sermon ; but the text , print in , be still extant . noise in the hill continue to be report from year to year , and still form a puzzle to geologist and physiographer . other tradition tell of foul odor near the hill - crown circle of stone pillar , and of rush airy presence to be hear faintly at certain hour from stated point at the bottom of the great ravine ; while still other try to explain the \\'s ‚Äî a bleak , blast hillside where no tree , shrub , or grass - blade will grow . then , too , the native be mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwill which grow vocal on warm night . be vow that the bird be psychopomp lie in wait for the soul of the dying , and that time eery cry in unison with the sufferer \\'s struggle breath . if can catch the flee soul when leave the body , instantly flutter away chitter in demoniac laughter ; but if fail , subside gradually into a disappointed silence . these tale , of course , be obsolete and ridiculous ; because come down from very old time . be indeed ridiculously old ‚Äî old by far than any of the community within thirty mile of . south of the village one may still spy the cellar wall and chimney of the ancient house , which be build before   ; whilst the ruin of the mill at the fall , build in   , form the most modern piece of architecture to be see . industry do not flourish here , and the factory movement prove short -

room , do not dare to move until the last echo die away far down in . then , amidst the dismal moan from the stable and the demoniac pip of late whippoorwill in the glen , totter to the telephone and spread what news could of the second phase of the horror . the next day all the countryside be in a panic ; and cow , uncommunicative group come and go where the fiendish thing have occur . two titan swath of destruction stretch from the glen to the farmyard , monstrous print cover the bare patch of ground , and one side of the old red barn have completely cave in . of the cattle , only about a quarter could be find and identify . some of these be in curious fragment , and all that survive have to be shoot . suggest that help be ask from or , but other maintain would be of no use . , of a branch that hover about half -
