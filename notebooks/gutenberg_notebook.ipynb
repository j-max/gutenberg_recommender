strew meadow . those figure be so silent and furtive that one feel somehow confront by forbidden thing , with which would be good to have nothing to do . when a rise in the road bring the mountain in view above the deep wood , the feeling of strange uneasiness be increase . the summit be too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness , and sometimes the sky silhouette with especial clearness the queer circle of tall stone pillar with which most of be crown . gorges and ravine of problematical depth intersect the way , and the crude wooden bridge always seem of dubious safety . when the road dip again there be stretch of marshland that one instinctively dislike , and indeed almost fear at evening when unseen whippoorwill chatter and the firefly come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous , creepily insistent rhythm of stridently pip bullfrog . the thin , shin line of the \\'s upper reach have an oddly serpentlike suggestion as wind close to the foot of the domed hill among which rise . as the hill draw nearer , one heed wooded side more than stone - crown top . those side loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wish would keep distance , but there be no road by which to escape . across a covered bridge one see a small village huddle between the stream and the vertical slope of , and wonder at the cluster of rot gambrel roof bespeak an early architectural period than that of the neighboring region . be not reassure to see , on a close glance , that most of the house be desert and fall to ruin , and that the break - steepl church now harbor the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet . one dread to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge , yet there be no way to avoid . once across , be hard to prevent the impression of a faint , malign odor about the village street , as of the massed mold and decay of century . be always a relief to get clear of the place , and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hill and across the level country beyond till rejoin the pike . afterward one sometimes learn that one have be through . outsider visit as seldom as possible , and since a certain season of horror all the signboard point toward have be take down . the scenery , judge by any ordinary esthetic canon , be more than commonly beautiful ; yet there be no influx of artist or summer tourist . two century ago , when talk of witch - blood , - , and strange forest presence be not laugh at , be the custom to give reason for avoid the locality . in sensible age — since the horror of    be hush up by those who have the town \\'s and the world \\'s welfare at heart — people shun without know exactly why . perhaps one reason — though can not apply to uninformed stranger — be that the native be now repellently decadent , have go far along that path of retrogression so common in many backwater . have come to form a race by , with the well - define mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding . the average of intelligence be wofully low , whilst annals reek of overt viciousness and of half - hide murder , incest , and deed of almost unnamable violence and perversity . the old gentry , represent the two or three armigerous family which come from in   , have keep somewhat above the general level of decay ; though many branch be sink into the sordid populace so deeply that only name remain as a key to the origin disgrace . some of the and bishop still send eld son to and , though those son seldom return to the molder gambrel roof under which and ancestor be bear . no one , even those who have the fact concern the recent horror , can say just what be the matter with ; though old legend speak of unhallowed rite and conclave of the indians , amidst which call forbid shape of shadow out of the great rounded hill , and make wild orgiastic prayer that be answer by loud cracking and rumbling from the ground below . in    the , newly come to the at , preach a memorable sermon on the close presence of and imp , in which say : must be allow\\'d that these blasphemy of an infernall train of dæmons be matter of too common to be deny\\'d ; the cursed voices of and , of and , be hear from under by above a score of credible witness now live . do not more than a fortnight ago catch a very plain of evill powers in the behind ; wherein there be a and , , , and , such as no thing of this cou\\'d raise up , and which must need have come from those caves that only black can discover , and only the unlock . . disappear soon after deliver this sermon ; but the text , print in , be still extant . noise in the hill continue to be report from year to year , and still form a puzzle to geologist and physiographer . other tradition tell of foul odor near the hill - crown circle of stone pillar , and of rush airy presence to be hear faintly at certain hour from stated point at the bottom of the great ravine ; while still other try to explain the \\'s — a bleak , blast hillside where no tree , shrub , or grass - blade will grow . then , too , the native be mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwill which grow vocal on warm night . be vow that the bird be psychopomp lie in wait for the soul of the dying , and that time eery cry in unison with the sufferer \\'s struggle breath . if can catch the flee soul when leave the body , instantly flutter away chitter in demoniac laughter ; but if fail , subside gradually into a disappointed silence . these tale , of course , be obsolete and ridiculous ; because come down from very old time . be indeed ridiculously old — old by far than any of the community within thirty mile of . south of the village one may still spy the cellar wall and chimney of the ancient house , which be build before   ; whilst the ruin of the mill at the fall , build in   , form the most modern piece of architecture to be see . industry do not flourish here , and the factory movement prove short - lived . old of all be the great ring of rough - hew stone column on the hilltop , but these be more generally attribute to the indians than to the settler . deposit of skull and bone , find within these circle and around the sizable table - like rock on , sustain the popular belief that such spot be once the burial - place of the pocumtucks ; even though many ethnologist , disregard the absurd improbability of such a theory , persist in believe the remain caucasian .   be in the township of , in a large and partly inhabit farmhouse set against a hillside four mile from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling , that be bear at    a. m. on , the second of ,   . this date be recall because be , which people in curiously observe under another name ; and because the noise in the hill have sound , and all the dog of the countryside have bark persistently , throughout the night before . less worthy of notice be the fact that the mother be one of the decadent , a somewhat deformed , unattractive albino woman of   , live with an aged and half - insane father about whom the most frightful tale of wizardry have be whisper in youth . have no know husband , but accord to the custom of the region make no attempt to disavow the child ; concern the other side of whose ancestry the country folk may — and do — speculate as widely as choose . on the contrary , seem strangely proud of the dark , goatish -

room , do not dare to move until the last echo die away far down in . then , amidst the dismal moan from the stable and the demoniac pip of late whippoorwill in the glen , totter to the telephone and spread what news could of the second phase of the horror . the next day all the countryside be in a panic ; and cow , uncommunicative group come and go where the fiendish thing have occur . two titan swath of destruction stretch from the glen to the farmyard , monstrous print cover the bare patch of ground , and one side of the old red barn have completely cave in . of the cattle , only about a quarter could be find and identify . some of these be in curious fragment , and all that survive have to be shoot . suggest that help be ask from or , but other maintain would be of no use . , of a branch that hover about half -
