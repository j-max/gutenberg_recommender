when to listen to everything have to say , and when just to shrug and tell to snap out of . anyway , be not make any big claim for . know carer , work now , who be just as good and do not get half the credit . if be one of , can understand how may get resentful — about bedsit , car , above all , the way get to pick and choose who look after . and be a student — which be enough by sometimes to get people ’s back up . , say , get to pick and choose , and always choose own kind : people from , or one of the other privileged estate . no wonder have a great record . have hear say enough , so be sure have hear plenty more , and maybe there ’ something in . but be not the first to be allow to pick and choose , and doubt if will be the last . and anyway , have do share of look after donor bring up in every kind of place . by the time finish , remember , will have do twelve year of this , and ’ only for the last six have let choose . and why should not ? carer be not machine . try and do good for every donor , but in the end , wear down . do not have unlimited patience and energy . so when get a chance to choose , of course , choose own kind . that ’ natural . there ’ no way could have go on for as long as have if would stop feel for donor every step of the way . and anyway , if would never start choose , how would ever have get close again to and after all those years?but these day , of course , there be few and few donor leave who remember , and so in practice , have not be choose that much . as say , the work get a lot harder when do not have that deep link with the donor , and though will miss be a carer , feel just about right to be finish at last come the end of the year . , incidentally , be only the third or fourth donor get to choose . already have a carer assign to at the time , and remember take a bit of nerve on part . but in the end manage , and the instant see again , at that recovery centre in , all difference — while do not exactly vanish — seem not nearly as important as all the other thing : like the fact that would grown up together at , the fact that know and remember thing no one else do . ’ ever since then , suppose , start seek out for donor people from the past , and whenever could , people from . there have be time over the year when have try to leave behind , when have tell should not look back so much . but then there come a point when just stop resist . have to do with this particular donor have once , in third year as a carer ; be reaction when mention be from . would just come through third donation , have not go well , and must have know be not go to make . could hardly breathe , but look towards and say : . bet that be a beautiful place . then the next morning , when be make conversation to keep mind off all , and ask where would grown up , mention some place in and face beneath the blotch go into a completely new kind of grimace . and realise then how desperately do not want remind . instead , want to hear about . so over the next five or six day , tell whatev want to know , and would lie there , all hook up , a gentle smile break through . would ask about the big thing and the little thing . about guardian , about how each have own collection chest under bed , the football , the rounder , the little path that take all round the outside of the main house , round all nook and cranny , the duck pond , the food , the view from the over the field on a foggy morning . sometimes would make say thing over and over ; thing would tell only the day before , would ask about like would never tell . do have a sport pavilion ? which guardian be special favourite ? at first think this be just the drug , but then realise mind be clear enough . what want be not just to hear about , but to remember , just like have be own childhood . know be close to complete and so that ’ what be do : get to describe thing to , so would really sink in , so that maybe during those sleepless night , with the drug and the pain and the exhaustion , the line would blur between what be memory and what be . that be when first understand , really understand , just how lucky would be — , , , all the rest of .. drive around the country now , still see thing that will remind of . may pass the corner of a misty field , or see part of a large house in the distance as come down the side of a valley , even a particular arrangement of poplar tree up on a hillside , and will think : maybe that ’ ! have find ! this actually be ! then see ’ impossible and go on driving , thought drift on elsewhere . in particular , there be those pavilion . spot all over the country , stand on the far side of playing field , little white prefab building with a row of window unnaturally high up , tuck almost under the eaf . think build a whole lot like that in the fifty and sixty , which be probably when be put up . if drive past one keep look over to for as long as possible , and one day will crash the car like that , but keep do . not long ago be drive through an empty stretch of and see one beside a cricket ground so like our at actually turn the car and go back for a second look . love sport pavilion , maybe because remind of those sweet little cottage people always have in picture book when be young . can remember back in the juniors , plead with guardian to hold the next lesson in the pavilion instead of the usual room . then by the time be in   be twelve , go on thirteen — the pavilion have become the place to hide out with good friend when want to get away from the rest of . the pavilion be big enough to take two separate group without bother each other — in the summer , a third group could hang about out on the veranda . but ideally and friend want the place just to yourself , so there be often jockey and arguing . the guardian be always tell to be civilised about , but in practice , need to have some strong personality in group to stand a chance of get the pavilion during a break or free period . be not exactly the wilting type , but suppose be really because of get in there as often as do . usually just spread around the chair and bench — be five of , six if come along — and have a good gossip . there be a kind of conversation that could only happen when be hide away in the pavilion ; may discuss something that be worry , or may end up scream with laughter , or in a furious row . mostly , be a way to unwind for a while with close friend . on the particular afternoon be now think of , be stand up on stool and bench , crowd around the high window . that give a clear view of the where about a dozen boy from year and senior    have gather to play football . there be bright sunshine , but must have be rain earlier that day because can remember how the sun be glint on the muddy surface of the grass . someone say should not be so obvious about watch , but hardly move back at all . then say : do not suspect a thing . look at . really do not suspect a thing . when say this , look at and search for sign of disapproval about what the boy be go to do to . but the next second give a little laugh and say : the idiot!and realise that for and the other , whatev the boy choose to do be pretty remote from ; whether approve or not do not come into . be gather around the window at that moment not because relish the prospect of see get humiliate yet again , but just because would hear about this late plot and be vaguely curious to watch unfold . in those day , do not think what the boy do amongst go much deep than that . for , for the other , be that detach , and the chance be that ’ how be for too . or maybe be remember wrong . maybe even then , when see rush about that field , undisguis delight on face to be accept back in the fold again , about to play the game at which so excel , maybe do feel a little stab of pain . what do remember be that notice be wear the light blue polo shirt would get in the sale the previous month — the one be so proud of . remember think : ’ really stupid , play football in that . will get ruin , then how ’ go to feel ? out loud , say , to no one in particular : get shirt on . favourite polo shirt . do not think anyone hear , because be all laugh at — the big clown in group — mimic one after the other the expression that appear on ’s face as run , wave , call , tackle . the other boy be all move around the field in that deliberately languorous way have when be warm up , but , in excitement , seem already to be go full pelt . say , louder this time : ’ go to be so sick if ruin that shirt . this time hear , but must have think would meant as some kind of joke , because laugh half - heartedly , then make some quip of own . then the boy have stop kick the ball about , and be stand in a pack in the mud , chest gently rise and fall as wait for the team pick to start . the two captain who emerge be from   , though everyone know be a good player than any of that year . toss for first pick , then the one who ’d win star at the group . look at , someone behind say . ’ completely convinced ’ go to be first pick . just look at him!there be something comical about at that moment , something that make think , well , yes , if ’ go to be that daft , deserve what ’ come . the other boy be all pre- tend to ignore the picking process , pretend do not care where come in the order . some be talk quietly to each other , some re - tie lace , other just star down at foot as trammell the mud . but be look eagerly at the senior    boy , as though name have already be call . keep up performance all through the team - pick , do all the different expression that go across ’s face : the bright eager one at the start ; the puzzled concern when four pick have go by and still have not be choose ; the hurt and panic as begin to dawn on what be really go on . do not keep glance round at , though , because be watch ; only know what be do because the other keep laugh and egg on . then when be leave stand alone , and the boy all begin snigger , hear say : ’ come . hold . seven second . seven , six , five . . .she never get there . burst into thunderous bellowing , and the boy , now laugh openly , start to run off towards the . take a few stride after — be hard to say whether instinct be to give angry chase or if be panic at be leave behind . in any case soon stop and stand there , glare after , face scarlet . then begin to scream and shout , a nonsensical jumble of swear word and insult . all see plenty of ’s tantrum by then , so come down off stool and spread around the room . try to start up a conversation about something else , but there be go on and on in the background , and although at first just roll eye and try to ignore , in the end — probably a full ten minute after would first move away — be back up at the window again . the other boy be now completely out of view , and be no longer try to direct comment in any particular direction . be just rave , fling limb about , at the sky , at the wind , at the near fence post . say be maybe rehearse . someone else point out how each time scream something would raise one foot off the ground , point outward , like a dog do a pee . actually , would notice the same foot movement , but what have strike be that each time stamp the foot back down again , fleck of mud fly up around shin . think again about precious shirt , but be too far away for to see if would get much mud on . suppose be a bit cruel , say , the way always work up like that . but ’ own fault . if learn to keep cool , would leave alone . still keep on at , say . ’s temper ’ just as bad , but that only make all the more care- ful with . the reason go for because ’ a layabout . then everyone be talk at once , about how never even try to be creative , about how have not even put anything in for the . suppose the truth be , by that stage , each of be secretly wish a guardian would come from the house and take away . and although have not have any part in this late plan to rile , have take out ringside seat , and be start to feel guilty . but there be no sign of a guardian , so just keep swap reason why deserve everything get . then when look at watch and say even though still have time , should get back to the main house , nobody argue . be still go strong as come out of the pavilion . the house be over to left , and since be stand in the field straight ahead of , there be no need to go anywhere near . in any case , be face the other way and do not seem to register at all . all the same , as friend set off along the edge of the field , start to drift over towards . know this would puzzle the other , but keep go — even when hear ’s urgent whisper to to come back . suppose be not use to be disturb during rage , because first response when come up to be to stare at for a second , then carry on as before . be like be do and would come up onto the stage in the middle of performance . even when say : , nice shirt . will get all mess up , there be no sign of have hear . so reach forward and put a hand on arm . afterwards , the other think would mean to do , but be pretty sure be unintentional . arm be still flail about , and be not to know be about to put out hand . anyway , as throw up arm , knock hand aside and hit the side of face . do not hurt at all , but let out a gasp , and so do most of the girl behind . that ’ when at last seem to become aware of , of the other , of , of the fact that be there in that field , behave the way have be , and star at a bit stupidly . , say , quite sternly . there ’ mud all over shirt . so what ? mumble . but even as say this , look down and notice the brown speck , and only just stop cry out in alarm . then see the surprise register on face that should know about feeling for the polo shirt . ’ nothing to worry about , say , before the silence get humiliating for . will come off . if can not get off , just take to . go on examine shirt , then say grumpily : ’ nothing to do with anyway . seem to regret immediately this last remark and look at sheepishly , as though expect to say something comfort back to . but would have enough of by now , particularly with the girl watch — and for all know , any number of other from the window of the main house . so turn away with a shrug and rejoin friend . put an arm around shoulder as walk away . at least get to pipe down , say . be okay ? mad animal .']\n"
