strew meadow . those figure be so silent and furtive that one feel somehow confront by forbidden thing , with which would be good to have nothing to do . when a rise in the road bring the mountain in view above the deep wood , the feeling of strange uneasiness be increase . the summit be too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness , and sometimes the sky silhouette with especial clearness the queer circle of tall stone pillar with which most of be crown . gorges and ravine of problematical depth intersect the way , and the crude wooden bridge always seem of dubious safety . when the road dip again there be stretch of marshland that one instinctively dislike , and indeed almost fear at evening when unseen whippoorwill chatter and the firefly come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous , creepily insistent rhythm of stridently pip bullfrog . the thin , shin line of the \\'s upper reach have an oddly serpentlike suggestion as wind close to the foot of the domed hill among which rise . as the hill draw nearer , one heed wooded side more than stone - crown top . those side loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wish would keep distance , but there be no road by which to escape . across a covered bridge one see a small village huddle between the stream and the vertical slope of , and wonder at the cluster of rot gambrel roof bespeak an early architectural period than that of the neighboring region . be not reassure to see , on a close glance , that most of the house be desert and fall to ruin , and that the break - steepl church now harbor the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet . one dread to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge , yet there be no way to avoid . once across , be hard to prevent the impression of a faint , malign odor about the village street , as of the massed mold and decay of century . be always a relief to get clear of the place , and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hill and across the level country beyond till rejoin the pike . afterward one sometimes learn that one have be through . outsider visit as seldom as possible , and since a certain season of horror all the signboard point toward have be take down . the scenery , judge by any ordinary esthetic canon , be more than commonly beautiful ; yet there be no influx of artist or summer tourist . two century ago , when talk of witch - blood , - , and strange forest presence be not laugh at , be the custom to give reason for avoid the locality . in sensible age — since the horror of    be hush up by those who have the town \\'s and the world \\'s welfare at heart — people shun without know exactly why . perhaps one reason — though can not apply to uninformed stranger — be that the native be now repellently decadent , have go far along that path of retrogression so common in many backwater . have come to form a race by , with the well -

crown circle of stone pillar , and of rush airy presence to be hear faintly at certain hour from stated point at the bottom of the great ravine ; while still other try to explain the \\'s — a bleak , blast hillside where no tree , shrub , or grass - blade will grow . then , too , the native be mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwill which grow vocal on warm night . be vow that the bird be psychopomp lie in wait for the soul of the dying , and that time eery cry in unison with the sufferer \\'s struggle breath . if can catch the flee soul when leave the body , instantly flutter away chitter in demoniac laughter ; but if fail , subside gradually into a disappointed silence . these tale , of course , be obsolete and ridiculous ; because come down from very old time . be indeed ridiculously old — old by far than any of the community within thirty mile of . south of the village one may still spy the cellar wall and chimney of the ancient house , which be build before   ; whilst the ruin of the mill at the fall , build in   , form the most modern piece of architecture to be see . industry do not flourish here , and the factory movement prove short -

insane father about whom the most frightful tale of wizardry have be whisper in youth . have no know husband , but accord to the custom of the region make no attempt to disavow the child ; concern the other side of whose ancestry the country folk may — and do — speculate as widely as choose . on the contrary , seem strangely proud of the dark , goatish -

look specimen . evidently some blight or distemper , perhaps spring from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungus and timber of the filthy barn , cause a heavy mortality amongst the animal . odd wound or sore , have something of the aspect of incision , seem to afflict the visible cattle ; and once or twice during the early month certain caller fancy could discern similar sore about the throat of the gray , unshaven old man and slatternly , crinkly - haired albino daughter . in the spring after \\'s birth resume customary ramble in the hill , bear in misproportioned arm the swarthy child . public interest in the subside after most of the country folk have see the baby , and no one bother to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seem every day to exhibit . \\'s growth be indeed phenomenal , for within three month of birth have attain a size and muscular power not usually find in infant under a full year of age . motion and even vocal sound show a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant , and no one be really unprepared when , at seven month , begin to walk unassisted , with faltering which another month be sufficient to remove . be somewhat after this time — on — that a great blaze be see at midnight on the top of where the old table -

alarm still shrill from the library . an open window show black and gap in the moonlight . what have come have indeed complete entrance ; for the barking and the screaming , now fast fade into a mixed low growling and moaning , proceed unmistakably from within . some instinct warn armitage that what be take place be not a thing for unfortified eye to see , so brush back the crowd with authority as unlock the vestibule door . among the other see and , man to whom have tell some of conjecture and misgiving ; and these two motion to accompany inside . the inward sound , except for a watchful , drone whine from the dog , have by this time quite subside ; but armitage now perceive with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwill among the shrubbery have commence a damnably rhythmical piping , as if in unison with the last breath of a die man . the building be full of a frightful stench which know too well , and the three man rush across the hall to the small genealogical reading - room whence the low whining come . for a second nobody dare to turn on the light ; then armitage summon up courage and snap the switch . one of the three — be not certain which — shriek aloud at what sprawl before among disordered table and overturn chair . declare that wholly lose consciousness for an instant , though do not stumble or fall . the thing that lie half -

white in the space between the purple ring . of genuine blood there be none ; only the fetid greenish - yellow ichor which trickle along the paint floor beyond the radius of the stickiness , and leave a curious discoloration behind . as the presence of the three man seem to rouse the die thing , begin to mumble without turn or raise head . make no write record of mouthing , but assert confidently that nothing in be utter . at first the syllable defy all correlation with any speech of earth , but toward the last there come some disjointed fragment evidently take from the , that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing have perish . those fragment , as armitage recall , run something like \" n\\'gai , n\\'gha\\'ghaa , bugg -

struck whirring and fluttering . against the moon vast cloud of feathery watcher rise and race from sight , frantic at that which have seek for prey . all at once the dog start up abruptly , give a frightened bark , and leap nervously out the window by which have enter . a cry rise from the crowd , and shout to the man outside that no one must be admit till the police or medical examiner come . be thankful that the window be just too high to permit of peer in , and draw the dark curtain carefully down over each one . by this time two policeman have arrive ; and , meet in the vestibule , be urge for own sake to postpone entrance to the stench -

room , do not dare to move until the last echo die away far down in . then , amidst the dismal moan from the stable and the demoniac pip of late whippoorwill in the glen , totter to the telephone and spread what news could of the second phase of the horror . the next day all the countryside be in a panic ; and cow , uncommunicative group come and go where the fiendish thing have occur . two titan swath of destruction stretch from the glen to the farmyard , monstrous print cover the bare patch of ground , and one side of the old red barn have completely cave in . of the cattle , only about a quarter could be find and identify . some of these be in curious fragment , and all that survive have to be shoot . suggest that help be ask from or , but other maintain would be of no use . , of a branch that hover about half -

mad voice shriek out , \" help , oh , ! ... \" and some think a crash sound follow the breaking off of the exclamation . there be nothing more . no one dare do anything , and no one know till morning whence the call come . then those who have hear call everyone on the line , and find that only the fryes do not reply . the truth appear an hour later , when a hastily assemble group of armed man trudge out to the place at the head of the glen . be horrible , yet hardly a surprize . there be more swath and monstrous print , but there be no longer any house . have cave in like an egg -

young of seven child . life have be inconsequential , if slightly amusing . have never stand out for any particular reason , save height , and even that be waste on a lack of skill on the basketball court . but learn to use this ordinariness to advantage . be a journalist . there be something soft and unthreatening about that make people want to talk . and have a capacity for disappear into event and thus , in that way , report out a scene . at home , build around ordinary thing — family , friend , and community . may never be a celebrated writer . but be a good father , a good partner , a decent friend . fame fuck with all of that . would show up to do job , to report , and become , if not the scene , then part of . would take wife out to lunch to discuss some weighty matter in life , and come home , only to learn that the couple next to have covertly take a photo and tweet out . the family dream of buy a home , finally achieve , become newsworthy . kid ’s account be scour for relevant quote . and when move to excise , to restrict access , this would only extend the story . be the oddest thing . feel to be the same as have always be , but everything around be warp . sense of as part of a community of black writer disintegrate before . writer , whom love , who have be mentor , claim tokenism and betrayal . writer , whom know personally , whom feel to be comrade in struggle , take to and to announce late heresy . no one enjoy criticism , but by then have take share . what be new be criticism that feel to originate as much in what have write , as how have be receive . one of good friend , who work in radio , come up with the idea of a funny self - deprecate segment about and weird snobbery . but when air , the piece be mostly concern with this newfound fame , how have change , and how all leave feel a type of way . be unprepared . the work of writing have always be , for , the work of endure failure . have never occur to that one would , too , have to work to endure success . the incentive toward a grand ego be ever present . be ask to speak on matter which work evidence no knowledge of . be invite to do a speak tour via private jet . be ask to direct a music video . begin to understand how and why famous writer falter , because writing be hard and there be writer who only do that work because have to . but be now clear there be another way — a life of lecture , visit - writer gig , gala , prize committee . there be dark expectation . remember go with a friend to visit an old black writer , an elder statesman . size up and the first thing say to be , must be get all the pussy now . what feel , in all of this , be a profound sense of social isolation . would walk into a room , know that some facsimile of , some mix of interview , book club , and private assessment , have precede . the loss of friend , of comrade , of community , be gut - wrench . grow skeptical and distant . avoid group dinner . in conversation , size everyone up , convince that be try to extract something from . and this be where the paranoia begin , because the vast majority of people be kind and normal . but never know when that would fail to be the case . related storiesmy be for lose top of the skewed incentive , the wreck friendship , the paranoia , the ruin of community , there be a part of that be leave to confront . be the lonely would ever feel in life — and part of love , love the way would walk into a restaurant in and make the wait disappear , love the random swag , the green , the blue jogger . love the movie star , rapper , and ballplayer who cite work , and there be so much more out there wait to be love . love small fame because , though have broker a peace with all ordinariness , with how fade into a crowd , with how unremarkable really be — and though decide to till , as say , own plot of ground , whole other acre now appear before . almost do not matter whether claim those acre or not , because who be if , even as do good , feel the desire to do evil ? the terrible thing about that small fame be how undress , strip of self - illusion , and show how easily could be sweep away , how part of want to be sweep away , and even if no one ever see , even if never act on , now know , know that could love that small fame in the same terrible way that want to live forever , in that way , to paraphrase , that drown sailor love the sea . but do not drown . feel the gravity of that small fame , feel gravity even now , and reveal security as sure as do insecurity , reason to preserve the peace . really do love to write — the irreplaceable thrill of transform a blank page , the search for the right word , like piece of a puzzle , the surgery of stitch together odd paragraph . love how belong to , a private act of creation , a fact that dissipate the moment step in front of a crowd . so , that really be . but more importantly , think , be thing beyond , the pre - fame web of connection around — child , spouse , brother , sister , friend — the majority of whom hold fast and remain . what would be both without that web and with a large , more menacing fame ? think of , whose father beat and call big nose . think of the sad tale of ’s rumor steal laptop . ( and as far as real friend , tell cousin love ‘ / even the one that steal the laptop , dirty motherfucker . ) think of west confess to an opioid addiction , which have origin in decision to get liposuction out of fear of be see as fat . and wonder what private pain would drive a man to turn to the same procedure that ultimately lead to the death of mother . there ’ nothing original in this tale and there ’ ample evidence , beyond , that human be not build to withstand the weight of celebrity . but for black artist who rise to the height of and , the weight be more , because come from community in desperate need of champion . ’s death be a great tragedy for legion of fan . be a tragedy for an entire people . when brilliant black artist fall down on the stage , do not fall down alone . the story of drug out , as put , reduce by the medium glare to liposuction , be not merely about how feel about body . be that drug - out who appear in that gaudy lobby , dead - eyed and blonde - haired , and by very presence endorse the agenda of . ifinally see michael jackson moonwalk in   , finally watch the myth descend into the real , though finally overstate the matter . have , by then of course , see the legendary tape of performance at   , but somehow be not yet real to , because have not share in the actual moment , at that moment , because still , after all those year , remember the longing of have miss a great event , and have experience secondhand . but this time really be there , live as be air — the    anniversary of ’s entrance into the pop - music world — and be thankful that happen then , at the end of that era of myth and legend , when the internet be still embryonic , and dvr be not omnipresent , and the world have not yet be , and reality television have just begin to peek over the horizon . this be a world still fill with the mystery , secret , and crank theory of childhood , where the manufacture tennis shoe and bottle iced tea , and ship all into the ghetto . what be say be that this be still a time , as in childhood , when mostly have to see thing as happen , and if have not see that way , there still be a gnaw disbelief as to whether have happen at all . think this , in part , explain the screaming and fainting . crank up and feel too . for when see glide across the stage that night at , mere day before the towers fall , do not imagine so much walk on the moon , as walk on water . and the moonwalk be the least of thing . whip mop of hair and , cuff the mic , stomp with the drum , spin , grab the air . be astounded . there be the matter of face , which take back to the self - hatred of the ' , but this seem not to matter because be watch a miracle — a man have be bear to a people who control absolutely nothing , and yet have achieve absolute control over the thing that always matter most — body . and then the song climax . scream and all the music fall away , save one solitary drum , and boneless seem to break away , until be just and that beat , carnal , ancestral . roll shoulder , snake to the ground , and then back up , pop - lock , seem to slow time , and see pull away from body , from the ravished face , which want to be white , and all that remain be the soul of , the gift give onto , carry in the drum . like to think think of while watch . but if not , be think of now : be say , will serve better if bring from naked and thing - less . so the bukra reason . tear away clothe so that may bring nothing away , but seize drum and hide in skin under the skull bone . the shin - bone bear openly , for think , who shall rob of shin - bone when see no drum ? so laugh with cunning and say , , who be bear away , to become an orphan , carry parent with . for rhythm be not mother , and be man ? so groan aloud in the ship and hide drum and laugh . there be no separate the laughter from the groan , the drum from the slave ship , the tear away of clothe , the be bear away , from the cunning need to hide all that make human . and this be why the gift of black music , of black art , be unlike any other in , because be not simply a matter of singular talent , or even of tradition , or lineage , but of something more grand and monstrous . when sing and dance , when west sample or rhyme , be tap into a power form under all the killing , all the beating , all the rape and plunder that make . the gift can never wholly belong to a singular artist , free of expectation and scrutiny , because the gift be no more solely than the suffering that produce . do not invent the moonwalk . when rap , and basically know now , get racially profile / up and hose down , pimp up and ho’d down , the be instructive . what seek be what seek — liberation from the dictate of that . in visit with , the rapper be stun to find that , despite endorsement of , have never hear of the travel ban . do not know the thing that know because ’ remove from society to a point where do not reach , say . call struggle the right to be a free thinker , and be , indeed , champion a kind of freedom — a white freedom , freedom without consequence , freedom without criticism , freedom to be proud and ignorant ; freedom to profit off a people in one moment and abandon in the next ; a stand ground freedom , freedom without responsibility , without hard memory ; a without slavery , a confederate freedom , the freedom of , not the freedom of , which call to risk own ; not the freedom of , which call to give even more , but a conqueror ’s freedom , freedom of the strong build on antipathy or indifference to the weak , the freedom of rape button , pussy grabber , and fuck anyway , bitch ; freedom of oil and invisible war , the freedom of suburb draw with red line , the white freedom of . would be nice if those who seek to use talent as entrée into another realm would do so with the same care which take in craft . but the god be fickle and the history of this expectation be mixed . fight apartheid . endorse a racist . there be a for every , an for every , or , more poignantly , just another . and suffer for this , because be connect . do not just destroy own face , but endorse the destruction of all those make in similar fashion . the consequence of ’s unlettered view of and history be , if anything , more direct . for fan , be the quality of art that ultimately matter , not pronouncement . if upcoming album be great , the dalliance with will be prologue . if ’ bad , then will be foreshadow . in any case what will remain be this — lending   imprimatur , as well as platform of some    million people , to the racist rhetoric of the conservative movement . ’s thought be not original — the apocryphal quote and the notion that slavery be a choice echo the ancient trope that slavery be not that bad ; the myth that black do not protest crime in community be pure ; and ’s desire to go to and talk to people on both side be an extension of ’s response to the catastrophe . these be not stray thought . be the propaganda that justify voter suppression , and feed police brutality , and minimize the murder of . and be now a mouthpiece for . be the young people among the despised class of who will pay a price for this — the child part from parent at the border , the woman war to control the reproductive organ of own body , the transgender soldier fighting for job , the student who dare not return home for fear of a travel ban , which be free to have never hear of . , in own way , will likely pay also for thin definition of freedom , as oppose to one that experience history , tradition , and struggle not as a burden , but as an anchor in a chaotic world . be often easy to choose the path of self - destruction when do not consider who be take along for the ride , to die drunk in the street if experience the deprivation as own , and not the deprivation of family , friend , and community . and maybe this , too , be naive , but wonder how different life may have be if know how much truly black face be tie to all of black face , if know that when destroy , be destroy part of , too . wonder if life would have be different , would have be longer . and so for , wonder what may be , if could find back into connection , back to that place where seek not a disconnected freedom of , but a black freedom that call back — back to the bone and drum , back to , back to home .\"]\n"
